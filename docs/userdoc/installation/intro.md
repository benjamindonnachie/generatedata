# Installation

Alrighty! Let's get this thing installed. This section outlines how to install and configure the script on your local
computer. If you want it running on your local intranet, that's no problem either. Steps:

1. Install pre-requisites.
2. Customize settings
3. Run the application

:::caution
These instructions are really for Mac/Linux. It should run in a very comparable way on Windows but if you have
any problems I would suggest [raising an issue](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/issues) and asking for help. It's 
very possible we'll need to tweak things here or there.
